# PHP Cookie Stealer
The PHP cookie stealer is a tool that can be used in penetration testing and XSS attacks to steal browser cookies from victims. The tool works by setting up a server that listens for incoming requests with a specific cookie value. When a request is received, the tool logs various information about the request, including the date and time, client IP address, user agent, referer, and cookie value, to a file.

This tool can be used by attackers to steal sensitive information, such as session tokens and authentication credentials, from unsuspecting users. By stealing a user's browser cookies, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's account and perform actions on their behalf.

## Usage

1. Clone PHP Cookie Stealer Project
```
git clone https://github.com/TheWation/PhpCookieStealer
```

2. Install a web server with PHP support on your machine if you haven't already. For example, you can install XAMPP, which includes Apache and PHP, from the official website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

3. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using a terminal or command prompt.

4. Create a new file called index.php and copy the PHP code into it.

5. Start the web server and navigate to http://localhost/your-project-name/index.php?cookie=your-cookie-value in your web browser, replacing your-project-name with the name of the directory where your project is located, and your-cookie-value with the value of the cookie that you want to log. For example, if the cookie value is ABC123, you would visit http://localhost/your-project-name/index.php?cookie=ABC123.

6. The server will log the date and time, client IP address, user agent, referer, and cookie value to the cookies.txt file in the project directory.

```

7. The server will also return a response with a status code of 200 if the request was successful, or a status code of 500 if there was an error writing to the file.

8. You can repeat step 4 with different cookie values to log additional data to the file.

9. To stop the server, stop the web server software.
